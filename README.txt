This tool displays data from Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story.
It's not finished, and I will change stuff as more things are found.

To get started, go to https://8y8x.github.io/mlbis-dumper and supply a ROM
file. Currently the JP/NA/EU/KO releases and NA/EU kiosk demos are recognized.

The primary motivation for this project is to find as much unused content as
possible. This tool isn't made for modding, but most useful functions (like
compression and saving to a file) are available globally in the browser
console.

- Near-complete field map support, including blending, tile and palette
    animations, collision, depth, loading zone, toggles, treasure, and map info
- Complete battle map support, including tile and palette animations
- Basic giant battle map support
- Basic menu map support

If you want to edit the tool:
(1) Download the repository
(2) Edit any .js file
(3) Open index.html in your browser
No build-step, no dependencies, no additional software.
There is a .prettierrc file that I occasionally use for code cleanup but you
don't need it.
